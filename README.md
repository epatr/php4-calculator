# A PHP4 Calculator Class

I recently joined a company that is using some capital 's' Seriously-legacy PHP object-oriented code. In an effort to teleport my brain back to those days, I dusted off my copy of Wiley's "Beginning PHP4" (&copy; 2000 Choi, Kent, Lea, Prasad, Ullman) and skimmed past all the `<TR>`s and `<TD>`s until I got to chapter 9 - "Objects". Yep, that's the code that'll take me back, right down to naming class files with an '.inc' extension! These were simpler times, without namespaces, public/private/static keywords, or anything else that makes OOP powerful. Hell, in the conclusion to the chapter they even say, "(PHP) has limitations that make it less powerful for really large and complex applications." And yet, that stopped no one.

As a warning to anybody that might stumble across this, the code in this repository is straight from the book. I just wanted to feel a tickle of nostalgia as I typed things like `<BR CLEAR="BOTH">` for the first time in 15 years. I imagine myself listening to Anti-Flag as I read this chapter the first time, wondering whether to go to college or start another band (I did the band thing â€” oops!).
