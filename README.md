# A PHP4 Calculator Class

I recently joined a company that is using some capital 's' Seriously-legacy PHP object-oriented code. In an effort to teleport my brain back to those days, I dusted off my copy of Wiley's "Beginning PHP4" (&copy; 2000 Choi, Kent, Lea, Prasad, Ullman) and skimmed past all the `<TR>`s and `<TD>`s until I got to chapter 9 - "Objects". Yep, that's the code I'm looking for, right down to naming class files with an '.inc' extension! These were simpler times, without namespaces, public/private/static methods keywords, or anything else that makes OOP powerful. Hell, in the conclusion to the chapter they even say, "(PHP) has limitations that make it less powerful for really large and complex applications." And yet, here we are.

As a warning to anybody that might stumble across this, the code in this repository is straight from the book. I just wanted to feel a tickle of nostalgia as I typed things like `<BR CLEAR="BOTH">` for the first time in 15 years. If I could find my old book on "Designing Websites with Perl" you'd be damn sure I'd be posting old flat-file guestbooks and traffic counters to GitHub as well!
