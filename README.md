# A PHP4 Calculator Class

I recently stumbled across an old enterprise PHP4 application that is in desperate need of modernizing. In an effort to teleport my brain back to those days, I dusted off my copy of Wiley's "Beginning PHP4" (&copy; 2000 Choi, Kent, Lea, Prasad, Ullman) and skimmed past all the `<TR>`s and `<TD>`s until I got to chapter 9 - "Objects". Ah, there's those old code conventions I was looking for, right down to naming class files with an '.inc' extension! Those were simpler times, without namespaces, closure, return types, or anything else that might give a semblance of testability. The book even concedes, in the conclusion of the chapter, "(PHP) has limitations that make it less powerful for really large and complex applications." Well, that sure didn't stop anyone!

As a warning to anybody that might stumble across this: the code posted here is transcribed directly from the book. I simply wanted to feel a tickle of nostalgia as I typed things like `<BR CLEAR="BOTH">` for the first time in 15 years. I picture my teenage self listening to Hot Water Music as I first read this chapter, wondering whether to go to college or start another punk band (tried both â€” bands won!).
