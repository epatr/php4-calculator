I recently joined a project that is using some capital 's' Seriously-legacy PHP object-oriented code. 

In an effort to take my brain back to those days, I dusted off my copy of Wiley's "Beginning PHP4" (&copy; 2000 Choi, Kent, Lea, Prasad, Ullman) and skimmed up to chapter 9 - "Objects". Yep, that's the exact same code I'm seeing in this project, right down to naming class files with a '.inc' extension! These were simpler times, without namespaces, types, or destructors. In the conclusion to the chapter they decide "(PHP) has limitations that make it less powerful for really large and complex applications."  

The code in this repository is straight from the book. I just wanted to feel a tickle of nostalgia as I typed things like `<BR CLEAR="BOTH">` for the first time in 15 years.
